Why to wirte this module 'bash' instead of using 'subporcess' which is built in Python 3 ?
    1.To use it as a bash on unix operation system purely, instead of a shell which also support on other opeartion systems
    2.To handle problems which I have faced with, I want to use 'env' 'stdin' params and executing params of bash programs
    3.To reduce exceptions thrown by 'subprocess' which makes programming smoothly instead of try to catch all exceptions
    4.To handle more complete situation, try to supprot async

Expected Target:
    1.support muti-processing
    2.support 'env', 'stdin' params and executing params of bash programs
    3.reduce execptions
    4.object-oriented
    5.supprot async (will be implemented next version)
